                    <p> Wood working is one of the most enjoyable hobbies for someone who loves to 
                        work with their hands and create. The shaping of flat lumber into a meaningful,
                        finished product is something that resonates deeply with me. From the initial
                        design, to the sanding, fitting, setting, and staining. Nothing is quite as 
                        satisfying.

                    <p> Photography of Sunsets and vistas is amazing. Each one is unique and and never the same
                        even if taken at the same place and time. Every one is new and in a matter of seconds,
                        the scene you were just observing has vanished into another.

                    <p> My youngest son is on the Autism spectrum and has exhibited several unique behaviors
                        throughout the last 9 years. When he was just 3 years of age he liked to turn light
                        switches on and off repeatedly. After having several bulbs burnout, I decided to make
                        him a box. I took a black plastic box and drilled holes to create places for switches,
                        LEDs, toggles, and buttons. I spent several hours soldering connections and wiring
                        until it was completed. My son loved the box so much, he (mostly) stopped his obsessive
                        use of our lights. To this day I have a tackle box full of electronic wiring components
                        making little additions to things around the house and fixing toys that otherwise would
                        thrown out.
